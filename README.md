# Pedestrian-Detection-Under-Low-Light-and-Motion-Blur

## Overview
This repository provides a pedestrian detection pipeline designed for challenging
low-light and motion-blur scenarios.

The system consists of three main stages:
1. Low-light image enhancement
2. Motion deblurring
3. Pedestrian detection using YOLO

Both traditional and deep-learning-based preprocessing methods are evaluated.
